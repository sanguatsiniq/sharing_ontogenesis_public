# sharing_ontogenesis_public
### Evolution of sharing ties through the household life-cycle and community growth

> [!NOTE]
> The small sample size and the temporal nature of the data means that we need to take extra care to maintain participant anonymity. 

In this public version:
- file "build_networks.R" which constructs the key data tables is not currently included
- excluded because it does some cleaning of data by household ID numbers, which we do not want to reveal given the small number of HHs sampled in both time periods 
- we'll try to rewrite include it in future versions

Please send inquiries and data requests to elspeth_ready@eva.mpg.de
